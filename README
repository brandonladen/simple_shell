**Simple Shell**
    This project is a simple shell program written in C. The shell allows users to interact with the operating system by typing in commands and seeing the output of those commands.

**Features**
    Basic command execution: users can execute commands like ls, cd, pwd, and echo.
    Input/output redirection: users can redirect input and output from files.
    Background execution: users can execute commands in the background using the & symbol.
    Signal handling: users can interrupt running commands using Ctrl+C.
**Getting Started**
    To use the shell, simply download the source code and compile it. Once compiled, run the executable file and start typing in commands.

**Limitations**
    This is a simple shell program and may not have all the features of a full-fledged shell like Bash or Zsh. Some commands or features may not work as expected.
